                <h4>Panthèon</h4>
                <p>On 4 June 1908, Zola's body was moved from Monmartre to the Panthéon, after a lenghty discussion by the commitee. 
                    This was not due to creation of the naturalism and his novels, but to his involvement in the Affaire Dreyfuss.<br/>
                    Zola shares the crypte with Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas (who was moved to the Panthéon at later stage). The door to the crypte used to be closed, but since few years is open and you can walk inside.

                <h4>Houses</h4>
                <p>Zola grew up in Aix-En-Provence. Due to the death of his father and the poverty that came after that, he moved a lot.<br/>
                    Unfortunately none of the houses he lived in has a commemorative plaque outside and some street changed name since. Therefore a lot is left to your own immagination.<br/>
                    If you'd still like to visit, here is a list of the addresses:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>33 cours Sainte-Anne (now 33 bis cours Gambetta) - between September 1843 and 1852</li>
                        <li>27 rue Bellegarde (now rue Mignet) -grand-parents house where he spends his holiday</li>
                        <li>8 rue Longue-Saint-Jean (now rue Roux-Alphéran) - moved in 1853</li>
                        <li>rue Mazarine (surely at n°2)- between 1857 and 1858</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4>House</h4>
                <div class="displayRow">
                    <p class="noVerticalMargin">Following the success of his books, Zola was able to buy a house right outside Paris, in the village of Médan.
                            The house is fully maintained and you can visit it, including the interior. You will be able to walk into his studio, with his original desk where he wrote every day.
                            Above the desk there's a sign with his motto "Nulla dies sine linea". It's latin for "not a day without a line", which represent his style and discipline in writing.
                            Emile Zola always approached a new book like a scientific project, with method. <br/>
                            The house had only one tower when he bought it. The second one was added with the income provided by Nana, hence it's called "La tour Nana".
                            The tour Nana is the north tower and it's square. Zola's studio is located at the top.<br/>
                            The third statue of Emile is in the garden in front of the house.<br/><br/>
                            The house can be reached on foot from the station of Villennes sur Seine. From Paris, you can take the RER A to Poissy and transfer to a Transilien train for one stop.
                            For more information about the house (only available in french),click <a href="http://www.cahiers-naturalistes.com/histoire_de_medan.html">here</a>.<br/><br/>
                            Please note the house is currently closed for maintenance and it is not very visible from the outside.<br/>

                        The hotel can easily be reached via the Overground from London, if you are in the area. You can find a plaque outside.<br/>
                        The modern hotel is a bit disappointing so you can see some pictures from the time <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02gj43c/p02gj3hj">here</a>.<br/><br/>

                     The building where they lived is supposed to be near the junction, possibly near number 12 rue de la Goutte d'Or.<br/>
                    The little square along rue des Islettes has been now named Place de l'Assomoir.<br/>
                    However, l'Assommoir from the book was a café, located at the crossroad between boulevard de La Chapelle and

                        we could assume this is the closest to the location in the modern Paris. The plan drew by Zola also has Avenue de l'Opéra in the same position.<br/>
                        They are located near the Stock Exchange/Opéra.<br/><br/>
